# aws-serverless-proxy

The serverless proxy accepts all HTTP calls and forwards them to a backend service based on the result of a Lambda function invocation.

Thanks to [AspNetCore.Proxy](https://github.com/twitchax/AspNetCore.Proxy) and [HttpContextMoq](https://github.com/tiagodaraujo/httpcontextmoq).
